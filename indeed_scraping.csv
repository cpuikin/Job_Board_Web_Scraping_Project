What you’ll do day-to-day
Interns will research, analyze, and perform due diligence on potential investments, all while gaining exposure to live deals as they progress. Since our approach sits at the intersection of finance and technology, our interns employ a number of technological platforms to analyze market data and ultimately make qualitative decisions based on this analysis.
Who we’re looking for
Ideal candidates will excel at both quantitative and qualitative problem solving, and will have an interest in financial markets (absolutely no previous finance experience is necessary, however).
Preference will be given to students approaching their final year of full-time study towards a bachelor’s or other advanced degree, though all are encouraged to apply.
Successful interns in this role will not only analyze new investment ideas but will also contribute ideas of their own.

Adapt To & Embrace & Drive CHANGE : Change may sometimes be unsetting, especially if it is unwanted or unexpected, yet, it is the only constant, where we must evolve as our customers expect more and as our competitive landscape becomes more demanding.
Walk the Talk : If you say you will do something, you better make sure you complete your task by the date it needs to get completed. No BS here, no excuses and everyone has a responsibility to do their part.
TEAMWORK : The best leaders are the ones that listen and at Prenetics here, our management understands from and crafts by listening to our team members to enable them to do their best.\
Be PROACTIVE : Being proactive is taking initiative in a situation. Being the first to step up and say, hey i can do this. Being proactive is becoming the emergent leader in a group. Proactive people are positive thinkers.
Be Passionate & Determined : Passion. Period. Sure we can do a job-anyone or any organization can just get the job done. But to get the job done exceptionally well? That takes passion.
Be Humble : Arrogance is self-destructive in the long run and though we take pride in our roles and results, we at Prenetics here, always live by that we are only as good as our last month.
Move Fast : Moving fast is one of a startup's greatest abilities. If you believe in something, get on it and get it done. Don't over think it, and just move.
Do Epic Shit : Building great and big things means taking risks. This can be often times scary and prevents companies from doing the big things they should be. However, in our world where things are moving so fast, we are guaranteed to fail if we don't take risks.",Assistant Technical Officer/ Laboratory Assistant,https://hk.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b50576b12629ae6d&fccid=5da89ba209f3b2e0&vjs=3,"Quarry Bay, Hong Kong Island",,"Handle and accurate recording laboratory data.

What It Is Like To Work At Telnyx

Telnyx is a complex machine with a simple purpose: connect people. We are an intelligent telephony engine, the beating heart of the Telnyx service that routes data along the pathways of our global, private network. We are drop-in APIs for hooking applications into our products, and an administrator portal that puts unprecedented control of configuring and orchestrating the Telnyx service into our customers' hands.

We're also an organization of industry experts and engineers focused on solving problems and building solutions. We're a concierge customer success team and a 24/7 support team. We're a communications partner, focused on agile and endless innovation, not a telecom slogged in antiquated processes and anti-competitive regulation. We keep the conversation going: the always-on, omnichannel, enriched conversation that the modern world demands.

Communications are coming untethered from devices, and more and more, they're migrating into our everyday platforms: our social media, our work applications, and our collaboration tools. But, that move started before there was infrastructure to support it—the modern internet will never offer the speed and consistency that real-time communications require. So, we built a network that does and a cloud platform tuned for real-time communications at every layer. Telnyx is the connective matrix, a worldwide nervous system, a high-speed rail tunneling through the information superhighway. We're the foundation for calls, texts and messaging today, for the internet of things, augmented reality and ""communitainment"" tomorrow, and for whatever enterprising imaginations can dream up after that.

We're Telnyx. We're the future of communications.

At Telnyx, we're looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity. You're encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn't precisely match the job description. Your skills and passion will stand out—and set you apart—especially if your career has taken some extraordinary twists and turns. At Telnyx, we welcome diverse perspectives and people who think rigorously and aren't afraid to challenge assumptions.
